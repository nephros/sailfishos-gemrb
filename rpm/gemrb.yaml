Description: |
    GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a portable
    open-source reimplementation of the Infinity Engine that underpinned Baldur's
    Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. It sports a cleaner design, greater
    extensibility and several innovations. Would you like to create a game like
    Baldur's Gate?

    To try it out you either need some of the ORIGINAL game's data or you can
    get a tiny sneak peek by running the included trivial game demo.

    The original game data has to be installed if you want to see anything but
    the included trivial demo. On non-windows systems either copy it over from
    a windows install, use a compatible installer, WINE or extract it manually
    from the CDs using the unshield tool.
